    <h1>Wildlife Trade
    </h1>
    <br>
    <p>There will be no silver lining to the suffering caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, but there is a rare opportunity to learn a crucial lesson: The trade in wildlife must end.</p><br>
<p>COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus, likely jumped from bats to endangered pangolins and then to humans at a wildlife market for bushmeat in Wuhan, China. Three-quarters of new human diseases, such as SARS, Ebola and HIV, come from animals. These are known as zoonotic diseases and wildlife trafficking plays a key role in their transmission from animals to humans.</p><br>
<p> Journalist Lindsey Kennedy spoke on how the coronavirus outbreak could lead to the end of wildlife trafficking.In the case of COVID-19, we know that it came from wild animals. It's present in bats and pangolins, and snakes. We don't know exactly which of these animals provided the link to humans. All of them are trafficked and sold within China. And we don't know exactly how that virus moved. But what we do know is that when you bring wild animals into contact with humans and livestock, you massively increase the risk of all these different diseases jumping between species and going into the human population and just causing havoc.</p><br>
<p>-Talk to me about the markets where these animals are sold. You call them “wet markets.” What do they look like?</p><br>
<p>“It depends on where you are in the world, because they're not just in China. But, generally, imagine a big, sprawling market where it's not necessarily the cleanest, but you've got lots of live animals squashed into small spaces in cages — different types of animals in small spaces — and sometimes you've got animals being cut up and prepared for sale, even while you've got live animals still nearby. If you think about when meat is prepared in factories, how clean that has to be and how many processes an item goes through on a production line to make sure that a virus or a bacteria doesn't jump from one to another — none of that is happening in a big wet market like that. People are walking around, they're touching different bits of meat. People are sneezing, animals are touching each other. It's just chaos, really, in terms of virus prevention.” - Lindsey Kennedy</p><br>
<h3>China cracks down on wildlife trade amid coronavirus outbreak</h3>
<p>The Chinese government has instituted a ban on wildlife trade and consumption in an effort to limit the spread of the novel coronavirus after suspicions the virus originated at a now-shuttered live animal market in Wuhan, China.</p><br>
<p>The COVID-19 disease caused by the novel coronavirus has infected more than 80,000 people, killed more than 2,700 and now affects more than 30 countries. Scientists say the Wuhan market, which contained hundreds of exotic animals — both alive and dead — provided a perfect storm of conditions for the type of virus that can jump from animals to humans and spread.</p><br>
<h3>Not just China:</h3>
<p>China has much urgent work to do, but this is categorically not a “Chinese problem.”Collectors from across Asia, the United States, Europe and the Middle East, and many other regions drive the destructive trade in wild animals. In Vietnam, for example, the wildlife trade is worth over a billion dollars each year.</p><br>
MANU:
<p>To reduce consumer demand in China, the non-profit international fund for animal welfare   (IFAW) has run several innovative outreach campaigns, said Grace Ge Gabriel, the regional director of IFAW’s Asia chapter.</p><br>
<p>In one campaign, Chinese pop stars, athletes, TV celebrities, and CEOs denounced buying wildlife products in a series of public service announcements and ads that were posted on billboards, buses, in airports, and other public places. Another initiative targeted the belief that ivory comes from elephant teeth and the extraction didn’t kill them. An IFAW survey found that in 2007, 70 percent of Chinese people didn’t know that elephants died for the ivory trade. Three years into a campaign to change this misconception, they found that of the 44 percent of people who had bought ivory in the past year, . only seven percent said they would do so again </p><br>
<p>As the numbers of iconic animals dwindle, investors are seizing the opportunity to turn a profit. “Some consumers are now buying tiger bone, rhino horn, and ivory as investment assets, just as they would buy rare art,” said Mills. “They are basically banking on extinction.”</p><br>
<p>The panelists reiterated that the stated idea behind the amendments to China’s Wildlife Protection Law – that a legal market is necessary to reduce poaching – is dangerous and only increases demand and poaching. “These legal ivory markets not only provide cover for illegal trade, it also removes any stigma from consumers’ minds about ivory consumption,” said Gabriel.</p><br>
<p>They called on the Chinese government to outlaw industrial wildlife farming. They also highlighted the need for CITES to enforce a 2007 decision that all countries should not breed tigers for their parts or products, and tiger farms should be phased out. They emphasized the importance of public pressure on global leaders, and the continued need for awareness campaigns that educate the public. Few people know that so many of the world’s most recognizable species are being driven to extinction because they have become high-priced products on the black market.Without action, these animals could soon survive only in zoos or jail-like enclosures on commercial farms.</p><br>
<p>Wildlife crime is a big business. Run by dangerous international networks, wildlife and animal parts are trafficked much like illegal drugs and arms. By its very nature, it is almost impossible to obtain reliable figures for the value of the illegal wildlife trade. Experts at TRAFFIC, the wildlife trade monitoring network, estimate that it runs into billions of dollars.</p><br>

<p>Some examples of illegal wildlife trade are well known, such as poaching of elephants for ivory and tigers for their skins and bones. However, countless other species are similarly overexploited, from marine turtles to timber trees. Not all wildlife trade is illegal. Wild plants and animals from tens of thousands of species are caught or harvested from the wild and then sold legitimately as food, pets, ornamental plants, leather, tourist ornaments and medicine. Wildlife trade escalates into a crisis when an increasing proportion is illegal and unsustainable—directly threatening the survival of many species in the wild.</p><br>

<p>A selection of species threatened by illegal trade.</p><br>

<p>African rhinos</p><br>
<h3>Black and White Rhinos are among Africa's most iconic mega-fauna; gentle grazers and browsers who once spanned the entire continent.</h3>
<p>After years of ruthless poaching by organized criminal syndicates for their keratin horn, both African species of rhino are now threatened with extinction in the wild and in desperate need of protection. We're working to both reduce demand for their horn among target consumers in Asia,and develop innovative approaches to combating poaching and the illegal trade in rhino horn.</p><br>

<p>African Elephants</p><br>
<h3>African Elephants are arguably the most well-known species to be heavily impacted by illegal trade and wildlife crime, given that approximately 90% have been decimated within the last century.</h3>
<p>Global efforts to reverse this devastating onslaught on African Elephant populations have seen positive results, but demand for ivory still exists and illegal traders remain as resourceful and ruthless as ever. By closing domestic ivory markets which are contributing to poaching we can take significant steps towards ending a slaughter that has lasted for decades.</p><br>
<p>tigers
<h3>Tiger Panthera tigris populations have been devastated by poaching, illegal trade, human-wildlife conflict and habitat loss. Once common across Asian range states, these magnificent big cats are now estimated to number approximately 3,800 in the wild.</h3>
<p>TRAFFIC monitors the illegal trade in tigers and found that an average of 110 individuals a year have entered the illegal trade chain in Asia over the last 16 years. As a result of such findings, Parties to CITES are now committed to phasing out tiger farming, which contributes to this trade and stimulates demand for their parts. Despite such positive moves, there's still a long way to go before wild tigers shed their Endangered status.</p><br>



<p>What is wildlife trade?</p><br>
<p>Whenever people sell or exchange wild animal and plant resources, this is wildlife trade. It can involve live animals and plants or all kinds of wild animal and plant products. Wildlife trade is easiest to track when it is from one country to another because it must be checked, and often recorded, at Customs checkpoints.</p><br>
<p>Why do people trade wildlife?</p><br>
<p>People trade wildlife for cash or exchange it for other useful objects - for example, utensils in exchange for wild animal skins. Driving the trade is the end-consumer who has a need or desire for wildlife products, whether for food, construction or clothing.</p><br>
<p>For a more detailed list of the various uses of wildlife.</p><br>
<p>What is wildlife trade worth financially?</p><br>
<p>This is a difficult estimate to make. As a guideline, TRAFFIC has calculated that wildlife products worth about 160 US billion dollars were imported around the globe each year in the early 1990s. In addition to this, there is a large and profitable illegal wildlife trade, but because it is conducted covertly no-one can judge with any accuracy what this may be worth.</p><br>
<p>What is the scale of wildlife trade?</p><br>
<p>The trade involves hundreds of millions of wild plants and animals from tens of thousands of species. To provide a glimpse of the scale of wildlife trafficking, there are records of over 100 million tonnes of fish, 1.5 million live birds and 440,000 tonnes of medicinal plants in trade in just one year.  </p><br>
<p>Why is wildlife trade a problem?</p><br>
Wildlife trade is by no means always a problem and most wildlife trade is legal. However, it has the potential to be very damaging. Populations of species on earth declined by an average 40% between 1970 and 2000 - and the second-biggest direct threat to species survival, after habitat destruction, is wildlife trade.</p><br>
<p>Perhaps the most obvious problem associated with wildlife trade is that it can cause overexploitation to the point where the survival of a species hangs in the balance. Historically, such overexploitation has caused extinctions or severely threatened species and, as human populations have expanded, demand for wildlife has only increased.</p><br>
<p>Recent overexploitation of wildlife for trade has affected countless species. This has been well-publicized in the cases of tigers, rhinoceroses, elephants and others, but many other species are affected.</p><br>
